## 题目描述

```
Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.  There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.  The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties.

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.  This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True if and only if Alex wins the game.

 

Example 1:

Input: [5,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: 
Alex starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say he takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
If Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Lee takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.
 

Note:

2 <= piles.length <= 500
piles.length is even.
1 <= piles[i] <= 500
sum(piles) is odd.

```
## 思路

由于piles是偶数的，并且piles的总和是奇数的。

因此Alex`可以做到`要不拿的全部是奇数，要么全部是偶数。   

举个例子： 比如Alex第一次先拿第一个

这里有两种情况：

1. Lee如果拿了第二块（偶数），那么Alex继续拿第三块，以此类推。。。

2. Lee如果拿了最后一块（偶数），那么Alex继续拿倒数第二块，以此类推。。。


因此Alex`可以`做到只拿奇数或者偶数，只是他可以控制的，因此他要做的就是数一下，奇数加起来多还是偶数加起来多就好了。
奇数多就全部选奇数，偶数就全部选偶数。 Lee是没有这种自由权的。

## 关键点解析

- 可以用DP（动态规划）

- 可以从数学的角度去分析
